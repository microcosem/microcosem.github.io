# Main projects

Much of my recent work has been done either for my professional teams or for small community projects on locally-hosted Gitea and GitLab instances; I am in the process of migrating more of the stuff I'm up to into this more public space.

* [Stealthcloud](https://github.com/microcosem/stealthcloud) is a delicious blend of Ansible roles for provisioning a Tor Hidden Service with a basic Nextcloud instance.

* [Hackers Next Door](https://hnd.techlearningcollective.com/) is an information security and social technology conference featuring presentations by the best of the tri-state areaâ€™s cybersecurity trainers, privacy rights advocacy groups, activist networks, and their constituencies.

# Other

I've contributed to [Ansible's AWX project](https://github.com/ansible/awx/), [OpenTasks](https://github.com/dmfs/opentasks), and other Open Source projects!
